    "Minecraft is a well known video game available on a wide range of platforms. You can play it on Windows, Mac, Linux, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, Android, iOS and many more. With such accessibility, it's no wonder this game is so popular. Minecraft is a game made up of blocks, creatures and user community. You can build, dig, create structures, landscapes, gather resources, craft items, connect with friends and more depending on the selected game mode! \n",

They have set up a MineCraft server, and players' actions are recorded as they navigate through the world. But running this project is not simple: they need to target their recruitment efforts, and make sure they have enough resources (e.g., software licenses, server hardware) to handle the number of players they attract."

    "Based on the simple linear regression plot, there is a weak relationship between time played and level of experience in playing Minecraft. We used simple linear regression because we hypothesized a positive relationship between time played and level of experience. Instead, there seems to be a very weak negative relationship between the two variables. The trend shows that as experience increases, the time spent playing decreases. The slope estimate of -1.11 indicates that for each increase in experience level, the time played decreases by 1.11 hours on average. The p-value of 0.55 is also not statistically significant, as it is way above the threshold of 0.05. So we cannot conclude that the experience level has a significant effect on the time played. \n",
    "\n",
    "The plot shows many extreme outliers, with some players spending over 40-60 hours playing Minecraft. These points may have had a strong influence on the regression line and contributed to the weak relationship. The majority of the data is also clustered around the low time values, suggesting that most players, regardless of experience level, are casual players. \n",
    "\n",
    "On average, the model’s predictions for a player’s weekly played hours were off by about 32.53 hours. This is quite high given that most players play less than 20 hours a week, suggesting the model may be heavily influenced by outliers or not capturing the pattern well. The RMSPE of our model is approximately 7.8 hours, so on average, our predictions differ from the actual played hours by about 7.8 hours. Since most players play fewer than 20 hours per week, this is a moderately large error. This suggests the model captures some patterns in the data, but still has room for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "This outcome was completely unexpected. We expected more experienced players to have a higher number of hours played, given their status and possibly a higher number of resources and achievements. The observed weak and negative trend may reflect other factors not highlighted in our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, if experience doesn't predict how much someone plays, this suggests that experience alone is not a reliable indicator of high data contribution. The observed outliers, however, do contribute a large amount of gameplay but they exist across different levels of experience. \n",
