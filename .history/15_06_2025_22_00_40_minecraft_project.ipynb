    "Minecraft is a well known video game available on a wide range of platforms. You can play it on Windows, Mac, Linux, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, Android, iOS and many more. With such accessibility, it's no wonder this game is so popular. Minecraft is a game made up of blocks, creatures and user community. You can build, dig, create structures, landscapes, gather resources, craft items, connect with friends and more depending on the selected game mode! \n",

    "Of course, such a game would mean millions of players everyday... so a research group in Computer Science at UBC, led by Frank Wood, collected data about how people play video games. They have set up a MineCraft server, and players' actions are recorded as they navigate through the world. But running this project is not simple: they need to target their recruitment efforts, and make sure they have enough resources (e.g., software licenses, server hardware) to handle the number of players they attract."
